Categorical data includes variables that represent discrete categories or groups, such as \"loan grade,\" \"employment status,\" or \"credit rating.\" Unlike numerical data, these categories do not have an inherent order or scale that algorithms can directly interpret. Therefore, we need to convert these categories into a numerical format that can be utilized by machine learning models.\n",

    "1\\. **Gradient descent-based Algorithms:** Algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks.  \n",

    "2\\. **Neural Networks:** Where the range of input data can significantly impact the training process.  \n",

    "Standardization is generally preferred when working with algorithms that assume normally distributed data or when features have different units and you need them to have zero mean and unit variance.  \n",
